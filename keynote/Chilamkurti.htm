               <b>Biography:</b> Prof Naveen Chilamkurti is the Associate Dean (International Partnerships) and Head of the Cybersecurity discipline at La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia. Naveen serves as the Technical Editor of the highly-ranked IEEE Wireless Communications Magazine.   He is also a fellow of IET (Institute of Engineering and Technology, UK). Naveen has supervised 50 research students at Honours, Master, and PhD levels; 10 PhD students have already graduated. He has successfully attracted 20 research grants since 2000 to support PhD Scholarships, fellowships, and travel grants for research collaboration. He has published 350 journal and conference papers, including IEEE and ACM Transactions. He is active in editing and authoring 9 books with Elsevier, Springer, IGI-Global and NOVA publishers. Prof. Chilamkurti secured 24 competitive grants from various sources, including SMART SAT CRC, Data61/CSIRO, Defence Science Institute, Australian Academy of Science, and OPTUS telecommunications. In 2021, I received the inaugural Australia-India Cybersecurity Infrastructure Grant jointly funded by DFAT and the Indian government. I delivered keynote speeches at various international conferences and workshops. I have an extensive research record in cybersecurity. I have published 350 journals and conference articles in Cybersecurity, IoT, Anomaly detection in IoT, the Internet of Medical Things, Wireless Security, Federated Learning in IoT, wireless multimedia, wireless sensor networks, and software-defined networks. I also edited and authored 9 books with Elsevier, Springer, IGI-Global and NOVA publishers. I have an excellent record in securing various competitive grants and awards. In 2019, I was ranked in the top 2% of researchers worldwide based on the publication citations in the information systems and networks category. In 2012 and again in 2018, I received the Australia-India Early Career Fellowship from the Dept. of Industry Innovation, Science, Research and Tertiary Education. I have successfully attracted 20 research grants since 2000 to support PhD Scholarships, fellowships, and travel grants for research collaboration. <br>    

I have actively participated in journal editorial roles as an associated editor, senior editor and technical editor for IEEE Transactions, Wiley, and other international journals for the past 20 years. I was recognised as an international expert in wireless communications and security. I have been active as an international assessor for national grants for Kazakhstan, the Swiss National Science Foundation, and Italian scientific grants. In 2022, I was also appointed as an International Expert Assessor for Major Innovation Fund- Alberta State funding, Canada.

               <b>Abstract:</b> With the development of blockchain and its support for privacy and security, more and more domains are adopting blockchain to build transactional networks, and the Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the popular domains that apply blockchain. The rapid replacement of IoT devices and their explosive number growth make the scalability and sustainability of blockchain a key concern. In this seminar, we aim to explore how to build a secure, high-throughput, scalable blockchain network in the large-scale IoT network. I will provide insights into our redesign of sharding architecture to match IoT networks' lightweight, mobile and unstable features. This work enables the advantages of parallel transaction verification and block generation with sharding while maintaining network security. Throughout the discussion, I will focus on a new two-layer transaction architecture framework, where we divide the consensus node layer (nodes running the consensus mechanism to maintain the blockchain) and the user node layer (nodes submitting transactions), and design an advanced endorsement protocol to defend witch attacks while saving energy resources. In addition, we developed a backup pool protocol to reduce the high failure probability of small consensus groups while ensuring scalability and high performance, and we reduce cross-slice transactions based on geographic location for user nodes to increase throughput.
