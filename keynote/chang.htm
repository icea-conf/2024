      Detection, and AI-based Malware Protection <br /><br />

      <b>Abstract:</b>
      Securing networks and identifying malicious activity have become critical concerns in our
      hyperconnected society. This keynote offers and explains an integrated framework for network
      security advances that integrates fraud detection, AI-driven malware prevention, and
      cross-chain IoT transactions, aiming to improve the resilience of digital ecosystems. <br />
      <br />
      A proposed architecture that tackles the end-to-end security of networked systems forms the
      foundation of this research. In order to guarantee equity, transparency, and data integrity,
      the first component focuses on protecting cross-chain IoT data transfers by utilizing
      cutting-edge cryptographic protocols and blockchain-inspired technology. By enabling safe and
      fair data sharing across many networks, this method serves as the cornerstone of a reliable
      IoT data marketplace. <br />
      <br />
      Building on this framework, the second element uses cutting-edge fraud detection methods to
      improve the security of digital payment systems. This study reduces the hazards of unbalanced
      datasets and offers strong fraud detection capabilities by utilizing machine learning models
      and data balancing techniques like the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE).
      This element successfully detects fraudulent activity, guaranteeing the dependability of
      financial transactions. <br />
      <br />
      The third part deals with malware detection for Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS)
      with AI-driven federated learning. Federated learning improves intrusion detection's
      resilience and flexibility by allowing models to be trained across dispersed devices while
      protecting user privacy. The suggested architecture offers proactive protection against new
      threats and is well-suited for 5G and 6G mobile IoT scenarios. It also achieves high accuracy
      in identifying network anomalies. <br />
      <br />
      These three elements work together to provide a thorough approach to network security by
      combining proactive malware protection, strong fraud detection, and fairness in data
      exchanges. This lecture will highlight the significance of an integrated AI-driven approach to
      protecting interconnected systems and give participants insights into how these breakthroughs
      collectively contribute to a more secure and resilient digital future.
