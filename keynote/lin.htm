               <b>Abstract:</b> As a large amount of data is collected daily from individuals, businesses, and other organizations or applications, various algorithms have been developed to identify interesting and useful patterns in data that meet a set of requirements specified by a user. The main purpose of data analysis and data mining is to find new, potentially useful patterns that can be used in real-world applications. For example, analyzing customer transactions in a retail store can reveal interesting patterns about customer buying behavior that can then be used for decision making. In recent years, the demand for utility-oriented pattern mining and analytics has increased because it can discover more useful and interesting information than basic binary-based pattern mining approaches, which has been used in many domains and applications, e.g., cross-marketing, e-commerce, finance, medical and biomedical applications. In this talk, I will first highlight the benefits by using the utility-oriented pattern mining and analytics compared to the past studies (e.g., association rule/frequent itemset mining). I will then provide a general overview of the state of the art in utility-oriented pattern mining and analytic techniques according to three main categories (i.e., data level, constraint level, and application level). Several techniques and modeling on different aspects (levels) of utility-oriented pattern mining will be presented and reviewed.
